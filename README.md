# Integrating IoT Devices for Monitoring and Enhancing Worker Conditions in India

## Overview
This project focuses on leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) to monitor and improve the working conditions of laborers in India. With sensors and wearable devices integrated into an IoT framework, we aim to enhance workplace safety, productivity, and overall well-being. The solution includes real-time monitoring of environmental and personal health parameters, ensuring proactive risk management and compliance with safety standards.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks temperature, humidity, air quality, noise levels, and worker health metrics.
- **Wearable Technology**: Incorporates sensors for heart rate, oxygen levels, and motion detection.
- **Data Analytics**: Processes and visualizes data to provide actionable insights for improving workplace safety.
- **Alert System**: Notifies workers and managers of hazardous conditions via integrated systems.
- **Cloud Connectivity**: Stores and analyzes data on platforms like ThingSpeak for long-term accessibility.

## Technology Stack
- **Hardware**: Arduino UNO, ESP32 DevKit, sensors like DHT11, MAX30100, Neo-6M GPS.
- **Software**: Arduino IDE, ThingSpeak for data visualization.
- **Protocols**: MQTT for communication, Wi-Fi for connectivity.

## Highlights
1. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Helps organizations optimize workplace conditions through actionable insights.
2. **Enhanced Safety**: Reduces the risk of accidents and occupational diseases with proactive measures.
